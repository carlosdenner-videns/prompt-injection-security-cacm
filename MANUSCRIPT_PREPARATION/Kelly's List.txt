Terence Kelly's alphabetical list of desirable properties for
practitioner-oriented articles.  These are neither necessary nor
sufficient characteristics; they're just features that, to my mind,
usually weigh favorably.  They're not necessarily orthogonal, nor
always mutually compatible.

I prefer an article that is...

* Actionable.  It improves how readers practice the craft.  I'm
  looking for lessons *taught*, not just lessons learned.  Articles
  that merely say, "Behold the Grand Thing that we have done!" are
  not actionable unless the Grand Thing is exemplary and readers can
  imitate it in their own work.

* Brief.  Prose often becomes clearer when tightened.  Better for
  readers to clamor for more than to quit before reaching the last
  page.

* Canonical.  It will be used in programmer job interview questions
  and taught to undergrads.  Reviewers should ask, Which companies
  will test job candidates for this knowledge? and, Which courses
  will incorporate this knowledge into the syllabus?

* Checked.  Reviewers have independently confirmed the main claims,
  run the code, reproduced the results.  The main claims should be
  falsifiable (though not false); non-falsifiable messages are for
  the Opinion section.

* Clear.  It's reasonably easy for large numbers of non-specialist
  readers to understand, evaluate, and apply the techniques taught.
  Reviewers should reject papers they do not understand.

* Concrete.  It presents exemplary artifacts (e.g., working code)
  where appropriate.  Artifacts can be code listings within an
  article or supplementary material provided on the side.

* Enduring.  It will still be a good paper 20-30 years on.

* Focused.  There should be a salient main contribution that stands
  out, versus a scattered grab-bag of contributions.

* Historically aware/rooted.  It relates today's concerns with the
  rich heritage of computing.

* Joyful.  Programming is fun, and a good article is a delight.

* Non-commercial.  It's not an advertisement for a commercial
  product/service/company.  To advertise in CACM, contact the ad
  department.

* Original.  I prefer to publish material that has not been available
  previously.  Before we re-publish/recycle an article or blog post,
  let's first see evidence that *new* readers will flock to it.  By
  default, assume it has already reached nearly all of its target
  audience.

* Popular.  It is aimed at, and intelligible to, and will be read by,
  a large audience of practitioners --- at least 100K.  Readers
  enthusiastically recommend it to their colleagues.

* Promoted.  The author takes all reasonable measures to ensure that
  the article reaches its target audience.  This requires a lot of
  active hard work from authors.

* Rigorous.  It teaches the reader to think more rigorously,
  mathematizing problems and solutions where appropriate.

* Self-contained.  It provides everything a reader needs to evaluate
  the main contributions independently.

* Universal.  All else being equal, I prefer timeless and general
  principles/patterns that are broadly applicable in many languages
  and on many OSes/platforms.

* Well-written.  Reviewers, readers, and editors wish they could
  write as well as the authors have.
