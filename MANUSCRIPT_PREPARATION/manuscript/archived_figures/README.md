# Archived Figures

This folder contains figures that were removed during the manuscript revision to reduce the "slide deck" feel and align with CACM Practice article style.

## Archived on: 2025-11-23

### Figures Removed:
- **fig4_detector_performance.pdf** - Detector performance histogram (data preserved in text and Table in Section 4.2)
- **fig6_complementarity.pdf** - Detector complementarity analysis (data preserved in text in Section 4.2)
- **fig7_threshold_invariance.pdf** - Threshold invariance plot (data preserved in text in Section 4.3)
- **fig9_learning_gain.pdf** - Learning-based fusion improvement (data preserved in text in Section 4.4)
- **fig10_obfuscation_fpr.pdf** - False alarm rates by obfuscation type (data preserved in Table 4.4)
- **fig11_novel_attack_tpr.pdf** - Novel attack detection by category (data preserved in text in Section 4.5)
- **fig13_adversarial_evasion.pdf** - Adversarial evasion techniques (data preserved in text in Section 4.5)
- **fig15_generalization_gap.pdf** - Generalization gap visualization (data preserved in text in Section 4.5)
- **fig16_architecture.pdf** - Original architecture diagram (replaced with clean TikZ diagram in Section 5)

### Figures Retained in Manuscript:
- **fig1_baseline_vulnerability.pdf** - Baseline attack success rate comparison (Section 4.1)
- **TikZ pipeline diagram** - Clean block diagram created directly in LaTeX (Section 5)

### Reason for Archiving:
These figures were removed to transform the manuscript from a research-paper/slide-deck style into a practitioner-focused CACM Practice article. All quantitative data from these figures is preserved in tables and inline text. The visual footprint was reduced from 10 figures to 2 essential visuals: one quantitative baseline chart and one architecture diagram.

### Recovery:
If you need any of these figures for presentations, supplementary materials, or technical reports, they are preserved here with their original quality and can be reused.
