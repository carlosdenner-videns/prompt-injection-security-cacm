### 31. Mitigation for Prompt Injection in A.I. Models Capable of Accepting Text Input

**Patent Number:** US-2023359903-A1  
**Country:** US  
**Publication Year:** N/A  
**Assignee:** Preamble, Inc.  

**Summary:**  
A system for use with an artificial intelligence (AI) model configured to accept text input, such as generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), that detects and tags trusted instructions and nontrusted instructions of an input provided by a user responsive to an AI model prompt. The system uses reinforcement learning (RL) and a set of rules to remove the untrusted instructions from the input and provide only trusted instructions to the AI model. The input is represented as tokens, wherein the tru...
